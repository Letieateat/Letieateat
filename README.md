## Hi there 👋

🎓 ## Ling-Yan Li
I'm Ling-Yan. I'm always curious about the unknown and thrilled to unveil mysteries like debugging! 
I recently graduated from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) with a master's in theoretical and applied linguistics, focusing on computational linguistics. 
I'm interested in various applications of computational semantics, such as sentiment analysis. Put differently, I'm keen on the interaction between machine learning and human language. 

✨ ## Apart from computational linguistics 

I have over nine years of experience in the public relations and publishing industry. I possess a proven track record in crafting compelling feature stories, proficient event management, and adept content marketing, public relations, and social media management skills. I hold a bachelor's degree in international relations from National Taiwan University.

🇪🇸🇹🇼 ## Location
I was born and raised in Taiwan; I moved to Barcelona in August 2023.
I'm open to working/living/traveling all around the world!
